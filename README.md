# kaggle-diabetes

## Task
The task was to create a classifier model which can predict if a patient has diabetes or not. The model is trained on a dataset procurred from kaggle. 

## Dataset
The dataset is procurred from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set .
### The dataset include:
* Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
* BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
* Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
* BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
* Age: Age (years)
* Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

## Models
### Models used and their respective accuracies:
* Random Tree Classifier: 98.4 %
* Adaboost Classifier: 80.6 %
* Gradient Boosting Classifier: 87.8 %
